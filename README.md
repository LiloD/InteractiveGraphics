Project 1_1:
  Simple 2D rendering labyrinth which has two random exits and the wall is determined inside the program.

Project 1_2:
  Based on Project 1_1 with user mouse interactivities. User can RIGHT click to select one square in the labyrinth
  and Highlight the squares adjacent to select square, then LEFT click one of the Highlighted squares to remove the 
  wall between the right click square and left click square.
  Basically you can create a labyrinth by your own.
